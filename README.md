Name:
  PCG radio log - pcg_radio.log
  PCG location log - pcg_location.log
  DUO radio log - duo_radio.log
  DUO location log - duo_location.log

How to use:
  put logs in "Logs" folder
  run readers
  run comparators
  exports will be in "Exports" folder

If there are issues in reading use the "Duo only" and "PCG only" folders to make sure the logs are readable.
Modify individual readers and to work with new log format. Replace the code in the main readers to accommodate.
